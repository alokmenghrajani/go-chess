A minimalistic chess program written in Go.

The main purpose for writing this was to spend a few days hacking on some Go
code to improve my coding skills (specifically my Golang knowledge).

I proceeded in the following steps:

1. parse and pretty print a chess board
2. generate a list of valid moves
3. write some code to solve "mate in N" puzzles, use some well known
   puzzles as test cases.
4. write some code to solve "selfmate in N" puzzles, use some well known
   puzzles as test cases.

Overall I'm pretty happy to have achieved both: I have a piece of code
which solves chess puzzles and I have significantly improved my knowledge of
Go. Some parts of my code are a little ugly, but I don't think it's worth
my time polishing this side project.
